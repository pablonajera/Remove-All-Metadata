# Remove-All-Metadata
This is an Applescript workflow that removes the Metadata off any MPEG-4 files input into it. This should only be used within legal means. No other use is intended.

# Requirements
This Applescript uses <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/wez/atomicparsley">Atomic Parsley</a>. Install instructions from them are available <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/wez/atomicparsley/blob/master/README.txt">here</a>. 

<i><b>Note: </b> Atomic Parsley can also be used to read, parse and set metadata into MPEG-4 files.</i>

It can also be installed via homebrew using the following command in Terminal. <br>
<code>brew install atomicparsley</code>
